# Serverless CloudFront - Lambda@edge Plugin

[![serverless](http://public.serverless.com/badges/v3.svg)](http://www.serverless.com)

This is a Serverless Framework Plugin to easily deploy lambda@edge functions to an existant CloudFront Distribution. This Plugin doesn't require the CloudFront Distribution to be under the same CloudFormation Stack. But it does require for the Serverless user role to have permissions to the target Distribution.

If the CloudFront Distribution is in the same CloudFormation stack and is being managed by other Serverless plugin, maybe [this other plugin is better](https://github.com/silvermine/serverless-plugin-cloudfront-lambda-edge) for you.
