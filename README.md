# Serverless CloudFront - Lambda@edge Plugin

This is a Serverless Framework Plugin to deploy lambda@edge functions to a CloudFront Distribution. This Plugin doesn't require the CloudFront Distribution to be under the same CloudFormation Stack.

If you don't care that the CloudFront Distribution is in the same CloudFront Distribution, maybe [this other plugin is better](https://github.com/silvermine/serverless-plugin-cloudfront-lambda-edge) for you.
